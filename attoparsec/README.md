# Attoparsec

Attoparsec is similar to Parsec but is focused on uncompromising performance.
Having no access to the internet currently, I am limited to the Haddock
documentation. I will work on developing first a ByteString example (I haven't
worked with them before, although it seems that they overlap well with standard
strings) and then a simple FASTA parser.
