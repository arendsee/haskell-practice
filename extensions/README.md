# Language extensions

Here I will describe various extensions of the Haskell language. Each folder
will describe one extension along with usage examples.

Caveate, many extensions tend to be used together, so one folder might contain
multiple extensions. I'll shamelessly concatenate extensions names in the
folder name.
