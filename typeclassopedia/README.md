# Typeclassopedia

This folder contains notes and exercises [Typeclassopedia](https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia).

I shall endevour, with limited expected success, to cover all the following topics from the document:

 1.  Functor
 2.  Applicative
 3.  Monad
 4.  Monad transformers
 5.  MonadFix
 6.  Semigroup
 7.  Monoid
 8.  Foldable
 9.  Traversable
 10. Category
 11. Arrow
 12. Comonad
 13. Colophon

To quote Typeclassopeda:

```
 It’s impossible to overstate the importance of [types]; the patient student
 of type signatures will uncover many profound secrets. Conversely, anyone
 ignorant of the types in their code is doomed to eternal uncertainty. “Hmm,
 it doesn’t compile ... maybe I’ll stick in an fmap here ... nope, let’s see
 ... maybe I need another (.) somewhere? ... um ...”
```

God! Do I know this feeling. Groping in the dark, randomly trying things. What
I love most about Haskell is that I generally do not feel so lost. Or at least,
I feel there is enough structure to the language that with time I can master
it. In contrast, some languages, like R or C++, are so gargantuan and exception
ridden, that full mastery seems impossible.

The paradigm pure languages -- such as assembly and to a lesser degree C (pure
machine), Smalltalk (object-oriented), or Haskell -- are perhaps more
fundamentally tractable than the composite languages.

Hmm, I should learn Smalltalk. Along this tangent, see
[here](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/musings/SmalltalkOverview.html), the
writer has style.
