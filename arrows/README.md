# Arrows

Arrows are a generalization of monads.

Arrows generalize functions. The Arrow instance of `->` is just function
application. More generally, though, an Arrow instance can be application with
some effect. An Arrow is a relation between an input and output.

# Material

 1. `https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Arrow_tutorial` - Practical
    examples, but no general explanation. It might be useful to come back to
    this once I have a better theoretical idea of what is going on.

 2. `https://www.haskell.org/arrows/` -  a brief but good introduction and has references.

 3. `https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia#Arrow` - of course typeclassopedia has a good discussion of arrows.
