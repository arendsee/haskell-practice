# Haskell Practice

I have been planning on learning a functional language for some time, but there
was never a sufficiently strong reason for me to do so. But recently,
I converted from Gnome desktop to Xmonad, a Haskell-based window manager. The
configuration files are all in Haskell. I don't understand them, but I really,
really want to remap my workspace keys. So ... learn Haskell.

I'll be mostly basing my studies (for now at least) on the quirky Learn You
A Haskell tutorial.
