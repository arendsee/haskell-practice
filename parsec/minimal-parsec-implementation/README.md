# Simple Parser

This is an implementation of a toy Parsec system following the original parsec paper:

    Daan Leijen, Erik Meijer (2001)
    Parsec: Direct Style Monadic Parser Combinators For The Real World

The code will roughly follow the code in the paper. Of course, the paper's
code was made to illustrate the strategy of Parsec, not work well on its own.
And a lot of pieces are missing. Here I will play around based off their
foundation. Maybe extending it a bit to be closer to the full blown Parsec. I
won't take this too far.
